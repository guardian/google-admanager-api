/**
 * This service provides operations for retrieving and approving
 * {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202202/SuggestedAdUnitService.SuggestedAdUnit SuggestedAdUnit} objects.
 *
 * Publishers may create ad tags that lack a corresponding ad unit defined in DFP,
 * in order to gather information about potential ads without needing to create dummy ad units and make them available for targeting in line items.
 * Any undefined ad unit to receive more than ten serving requests in the past week is treated as a 'suggested ad unit'.
 * These can be queried by the client and selectively approved. Approval causes a new ad unit to be created based on the suggested ad unit.
 * Unapproved suggested ad units cease to exist whenever their corresponding ad tag has been served fewer than ten times in the past seven days.
 *
 * This service is only available to Premium publishers. Before use, suggested ad units must be enabled for the client's network.
 * This can be done in the UI: in the Inventory tab, click "Network settings" in the left-hand panel, then enable the checkbox "Get suggestions for new ad units."
 * If suggested ad units are not enabled, then getSuggestedAdUnitsByStatement will always return an empty page.
