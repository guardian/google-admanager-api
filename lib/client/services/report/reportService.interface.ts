 * Provides methods for executing a {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202202/ReportService.ReportJob ReportJob}
 * and retrieving performance and statistics about ad campaigns, networks, inventory and sales.
 *
 * Follow the steps outlined below:
 *
 * - Create the ReportJob object by invoking {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202202/ReportService#runReportJob ReportService.runReportJob}.
 * - Poll the report job status using {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202202/ReportService#getReportJobStatus ReportService.getReportJobStatus}.
 * - Continue to poll until the status is equal to
 * {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202202/ReportService.ReportJobStatus#COMPLETED ReportJobStatus.COMPLETED} or
 * {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202202/ReportService.ReportJobStatus#FAILED ReportJobStatus.FAILED}.
 * - If successful, fetch the URL for downloading the report by invoking {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202202/ReportService#getReportDownloadURL ReportService.getReportDownloadURL}.
 *
 * **Test network behavior**
 *
 * The networks created using {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202202/NetworkService#makeTestNetwork NetworkService.makeTestNetwork}
 * are unable to provide reports that would be comparable to the production environment because reports require traffic history.
 * In the test networks, reports will consistently return no data for all reports.
