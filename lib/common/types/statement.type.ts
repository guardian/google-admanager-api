/**
 * Captures the **`WHERE`**, **`ORDER BY`** and **`LIMIT`** clauses of a PQL query.
 * Statements are typically used to retrieve objects of a predefined domain type, which makes SELECT clause unnecessary.
 *
 * An example query text might be **`"WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' ORDER BY id LIMIT 30"`**.
 *
 * Statements support bind variables.
 * These are substitutes for literals and can be thought of as input parameters to a PQL query.
 *
 * An example of such a query might be **`"WHERE id = :idValue"`**.
 *
 * Statements also support use of the LIKE keyword. This provides wildcard string matching.
 *
 * An example of such a query might be **`"WHERE name LIKE '%searchString%'"`**.
 *
 * The value for the variable idValue must then be set with an object of type
 * {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202405/UserService.Value Value}, e.g.,
 * {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202405/UserService.NumberValue NumberValue},
 * {@link https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v202405/UserService.TextValue TextValue} or
